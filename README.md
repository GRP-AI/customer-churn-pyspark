# Customer Churn Prediction using PySpark and Pandas

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a churn prediction pipeline using PySpark and Pandas in Databricks. 
After uploading and cleaning the data, a Random Forest model is trained and evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics. 
The workflow demonstrates scalable data processing and efficient ML modeling in a cloud-native setup.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Databricks
- PySpark
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Python

## 📊 Workflow Steps
1. Data ingestion from Spark table
2. Conversion to Pandas DataFrame
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Feature engineering
5. Model training (Random Forest)
6. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
